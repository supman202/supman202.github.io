<div class="peter"><p>The Federation of Nigeria was granted full independence on 1 October 1960 under
 a constitution that provided for a parliamentary government and a substantial measure of self-government for
 the country's three regions. From 1959 to 1960, Jaja Wachuku was the First
 Nigerian Speaker of the Nigerian Parliament, also called the "House of Representatives." 
Jaja Wachuku replaced Sir Frederick Metcalfe of Britain. Notably, as First Speaker of the House, 
Jaja Wachuku received Nigeria's Instrument of Independence, also known as Freedom Charter, on 1 October 1960,
 from Princess Alexandra of Kent, the Queen's representative at the Nigerian independence ceremonies.
 Queen Elizabeth II was monarch of Nigeria and head of state, and Nigeria was a member of the British
 Commonwealth of Nations.
</div>
 <div class="mathew"><p>The Federal government was given exclusive powers in defence, foreign relations, 
and commercial and fiscal policy. The monarch of Nigeria was still head of state but 
legislative power was vested in a bicameral parliament, executive power in a prime minister and cabinet, and judicial 
authority in a Federal Supreme Court. Political parties, however, tended to reflect the makeup of the 
three main ethnic groups. The Nigerian People's Congress (NPC) represented conservative, 
Muslim, largely Hausa and Fulani interests that dominated the Northern Region. 
The northern region of the country, consisting of three-quarters of the land area 
and more than half the population of Nigeria. Thus the North dominated the federation
government from the beginning of independence. 
</div>
<div class="joy"><p>In the 1959 elections held in preparation for independence, the NPC captured 134 seats in the 312-seat parliament.
[55] Capturing 89 seats in the federal parliament was the second-largest party in the newly
 independent country the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC). The NCNC represented
 the interests of the Igbo- and Christian-dominated people of the Eastern Region of Nigeria.
[55] and the Action Group (AG) was a left-leaning party that represented the interests of the
 Yoruba people in the West. In the 1959 elections, the AG obtained 73 seats.[55]
</div>
<div class="ruth"><p>The first post-independence national government was formed by a conservative alliance of
 the NCNC and the NPC. Upon independence, it was widely expected that Ahmadu Bello the Sardauna 
of Sokoto, the undisputed strong man in Nigeria[56] who controlled the North, would become 
Prime Minister of the new Federation Government. However, Bello chose to remain as premier of 
the North and as party boss of the NPC, selected Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, a Hausa, to become 
Nigeria's first Prime Minister.
